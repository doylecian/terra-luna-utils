### UST Market cap simulation
A question asked often by Terra community members is 'What would the price of Luna be if UST had a marketcap of X?'.
If you aren't aware, the circulating supply of Luna is inversely proportional to the market cap (closely tied to the adoption) of UST. Thus, as demand
for UST rises, so too does the price of Luna via a decrease in circulating supply

This program allows the user answer this question and calculate the hypothetical price of the cryptocurrency LUNA, when it's counterpart stablecoin UST has a
certain market cap, assuming 0 net inflow to Luna itself.
